# Application Form UI and API Integration

This project involves creating a user interface (UI) for an application template and integrating it with the provided API. The UI is designed using React JS and Typescript, with the use of the Ant Design library for design components. Additionally, the API schema documentation is implemented to ensure seamless integration.

## Features

1. **UI Development**: The UI for the application template is developed using React JS and Typescript. It is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive.

2. **Ant Design**: The UI components are built using Ant Design, a popular design system for React applications. This ensures a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

3. **API Integration**: The provided API, described in the YAML file, is integrated into the application. This includes making API calls to fetch and submit data as required.

4. **API Schema Documentation**: The API schema documentation is implemented to provide clear and concise information about the available API endpoints, request parameters, and response structures.
